Input: This 'MyResume' web application created using React has no user interface for manually typing in user information. All of the resume data, including name, contact details, education, skills, and projects, are directly hardcoded in the code.
Process: When we launch the app, React displays all entered user information neatly on the page. The application is in the file `Resume.js`, that groups all those details under suitable categories, Education, Skills and Projects. `App.css` was responsible for giving proper looks to things and keeping all text legible and readable. React also makes it simple to see changes instantly while youâ€™re working on the app.
Output: The output is a clean, structured resume presented as a one-page website. It contains sections for personal information, education, skills, and more.
